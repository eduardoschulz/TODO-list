# TODO list with Electron
**TL;DR**

Install nodejs, clone the repository and do the npm thing :
```
npm install

npm start
```
or 
```
electron index.html
```


**Clone and run for simple and ad free TODO list.**

This is a minimal Electron based application TODO list. The objective of this project is to improve ours coding abilities, expecially with javascript. This is NOT a KISS (Keep it simple stupid) filosofy application, but we tried to do as simple as possible for a JS program.

**Concept**
Just the essential, no stupid features. No functional graphical actions and useless buttons.


## To Use
To "install" this program you'll need NodeJS. With that installed you will have acess to npm.

**Installation**
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/eduardoschulz/todo-list
# Go into the repository
cd todo-list
# Install dependencies
npm install
# Run the app
npm start
```
PS: If your're running Linux on Windows with WSL [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.
